        <p><b>Co-designing territories: a new type of public intervention?</b></p><p>Participatory design, or co-design, is now being applied to design and innovation activities on a territorial scale. Our thesis seeks to analyze the role of design and designers in this emerging field of study and practice. We want to understand why design is called upon by territories, and how it contributes to mobilizing stakeholders, ensuring their alignment and transforming temporally limited participation into long-term commitment. </p>
