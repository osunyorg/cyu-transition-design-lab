biography: >-
  <p>Throughout her design studies, Delphine developed an interest towards systemic design. Her double degree in design and innovation mixes sustainable transition with design methodologies. </p><p>Today through the thesis, she studies the ways of helping big organizations transform themselves from within, using design tools and questioning how archives and day-to-day practices can participate in this transformation.</p>

        <p><b>Organisations’ transitions towards sustainable ecosystems : transition design as a theoretical and methodological frame.</b></p><p>This thesis aims to examine the design practices implemented in organizational transition processes. We aim to identify how these practices fit into complex systems. We assume that organizational transitions towards sustainability depend on their ability to visualize and archive the systems in which they are rooted and towards which they strive.</p><p>Using the design transition methodology, we use field projects to study how design tools can help employees of a big firm to transition towards a more sustainable system.</p>
