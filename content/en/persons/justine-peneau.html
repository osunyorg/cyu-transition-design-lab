biography: >-
  <p> Justine Peneau holds a Ph.D. in Design since January 2023. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher within the Design research group, as part of the PEPR LINDDA project: Living Infrastructure to Design responsible Digital technology for Agroecological transition. Her research explores the temporal dimension of design, particularly in the context of collaborative and/or participative design approaches. She examines time from an anthropological perspective, viewing it as a framework that simultaneously enables and constrains interactions, productions, know-how, tools, etc. Following a sociology of emergence, she also observes the dynamics at play in co-design situations.  </p>
