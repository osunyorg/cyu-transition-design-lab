        <p>For him, design is both a subject of study and a multidisciplinary profession aimed at enhancing the conviviality of objects. This is how he defines the interface: a mediation between humans and technology, a protean entity, digital or not, whose design must be perceptible and practical. His skills are diverse and organized into four domains: graphic design for identities, volumetric design for products, digital design for interactions, and strategic design for perspectives.</p>
