biography: >-
  <p> Jean-Louis Soubret holds a PhD in Information and Communication Science  and teaches Design at CY Tech, the engineering school of CY University.  His research primarily addresses knowledge design (i.e. both the design  of knowledge and the knowledge of design), phygital publishing systems  and transmedia storytelling. Before he jumped over on the academic side  of the fence, he had been an academic publisher for over 20 years. As  such, and in continuity with his more recent capacity as a researcher,  he has been focused on innovations in book and journal publishing. He  has worked along, and is still cooperating with, professionals,  entrepreneurs, digital humanists and designers.  </p>
