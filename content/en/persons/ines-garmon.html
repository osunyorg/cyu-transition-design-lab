biography: >-
  <p>Her research focuses on digital transformations, interface design, digital interaction gestures, the body and its commodification, the practices and uses of "new technologies," and the discourses and narratives surrounding digital media. Her doctoral research specifically explored the issues and power dynamics of interface design by proposing a communicational anthropology of the "small gestures" used to manipulate touchscreen interfaces. Since her postdoctoral work, she has examined the relationship between the body and digital industries, adopting a cross-disciplinary approach that combines the anthropology of the communicative body, the anthropology of technology, and a pragmatic focus on lived experience. Her research interests extend further to the tools, practices, and challenges of contemporary digital design.</p><p>I am an associate member of the GRIPIC research lab at CELSA (Sorbonne University), and a research associate at the LabCom MeetUX (Grenoble Alpes University)      </p>
