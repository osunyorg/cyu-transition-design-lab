biography: >-
  <p>Her research focuses on contemporary practices of design and more particularly on "extreme" design that takes place in scientific research, political contexts, as well as the industry and that changes the definition and scope of traditional design activities. She also works on the epistemology of design as an "indiscipline". She has been involved in the production of works of art as well as in academic and industrial research projects. In particular, she has worked on distributed architectures, pervasive computing, open data, and Virtual Intelligent Agents. She works with artists, designers, philosophers, and researchers in fundamental sciences and engineering to understand design as a science of conception that connects a diversity of practices.<br></p>

        <p>                 Her research focuses on the materiality and generativity of design practices as well as on the tools and evolutions of collaborative design. In particular, she works on the scaling up of codesign methods to facilitate the creation of new sustainable eco-systems (territorial design, design and public policies, design and complex systems). She also studies the epistemology of design as a multidisciplinary practice that brings together the humanities, social sciences and engineering sciences. She co-directs the research project « Lindda » with INRIA and INRAE: Living INfrastructure to Design responsible Digital technology for Agroecological transition. The research project studies how design can support the agro-ecological transition.    @font-face 	{font-family:"Cambria Math"; 	panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:roman; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-unhide:no; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""; 	margin:0cm; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:"Times New Roman",serif; 	mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";}.MsoChpDefault 	{mso-style-type:export-only; 	mso-default-props:yes; 	font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; 	mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; 	mso-font-kerning:0pt; 	mso-ligatures:none; 	mso-fareast-language:EN-US;}div.WordSection1 	{page:WordSection1;}</p>
