<p>Her research focuses on contemporary practices of design and more particularly on "extreme" design that takes place in scientific research, political contexts, as well as the industry and that changes the definition and scope of traditional design activities. She also works on the epistemology of design as an "indiscipline". She has been involved in the production of works of art as well as in academic and industrial research projects. In particular, she has worked on distributed architectures, pervasive computing, open data, and Virtual Intelligent Agents. She works with artists, designers, philosophers, and researchers in fundamental sciences and engineering to understand design as a science of conception that connects a diversity of practices.<br></p>
