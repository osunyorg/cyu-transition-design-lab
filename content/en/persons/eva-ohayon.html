    <p>Thesis Summary  <br>Transition strategies with and for organizations: what methodologies and tools to anticipate and design futures compatible with planetary and societal limits? To thrive and meet new regulations, companies must comply with planetary boundaries while bringing value to their consumers and collaborators. Traditional strategy tools become obsolete: choosing between defined sets of options creates errors and frustrations. This thesis explores new methodologies and tools that allow companies to anticipate and design desirable and sustainable futures. In particular, it investigates the potential of GenAI to help companies simulate and share future visions.   <br>Keywords: transition design, innovation, foresight, strategy, Artificial Intelligence</p>
