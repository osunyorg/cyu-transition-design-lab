  This article analyzes the Transition Design Framework as formulated during the first conference on this theme organized by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburg in 2015. First, we want to identify how the issues of sustainable transition are expressed and articulated with design research at this moment in the history of design by the researchers who took part in this inaugural conference. After analyzing the texts and their few references to information and communication issues, we propose to examine how certain foundational concepts of Transition Design, particularly the notions of engagement and vision, can be better understood through the theoretical framework of mediations. We suggest that these concepts can find a rigorous epistemological foundation within information and communication sciences, enabling new convergences with design sciences.
