abstract: >-
  <p>This article examines the relevance of existing inclusive codesign methodologies for designing more inclusive public policies, in the current context calling for an inclusive transition. The semi-systematic analysis of a corpus of 37 texts reveals that these methodologies are anchored in an integrative rather than an inclusive paradigm, and therefore do not allow for an inclusive (re)design of public policies, towards an inclusive societal transition. Indeed, they do not allow for the representativeness of the entire ecosystem of stakeholders, nor the creation of solutions at the systemic scale of transitions. However, this analysis leads us to recommend working on the prefiguration phase of these inclusive participatory processes -in particular on the recruitment and alignment processes of participants -to adapt them to the scale of designing the inclusive transition of public policies.</p>
