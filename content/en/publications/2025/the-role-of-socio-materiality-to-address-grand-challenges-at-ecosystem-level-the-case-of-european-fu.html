abstract: >-
  The complexity of the current environmental and societal challenges can be tackled by innovation ecosystems (Kaufmann & Danner-Schröder, 2022, Ritala, 2024), which involve actors, activities, artifacts, institutions and relations across industries (Granstrand & Holgersson, 2020). As stated by Mele and Russo-Spena (2019), the composition of new complex adaptive service systems emerges through new socio-material practices integrating knowledge, tools, languages and artefacts. The paper presents empirical evidence on the entanglement between social and material aspects of artefacts in fostering stakeholders’ collaboration in two European initiatives related to sustainable mobility ecosystem emergence. Stakeholder engagement in co-design requires context-specific artifacts that, through symbolic function, iteratively mediate representations and contribute to shape the social dynamics for collaborative and coordinated agency.
