abstract: >-
  In this paper we describe a brainstorming session with visually impaired users, a sighted locomotion trainer, as well as sighted and blind researchers. This brainstorming session was part of a larger project on designing accessible guidance systems for visually impaired people. In this session we specifically addressed the design of an accessible route calculation tool. In a method story, we describe how this session took place and report our insights from this experience on adapting brainstorming to a non-visual world.
