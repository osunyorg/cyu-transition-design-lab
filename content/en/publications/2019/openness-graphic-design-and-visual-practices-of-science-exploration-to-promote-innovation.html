abstract: >-
  This article presents an ongoing research on the visual practices of experimental scientists. We look at the way scientific visuals are constructed, to understand how the processes promote exploration and expansion, which are central proprieties supporting innovation in the context of scientific research. Based on a series of in-situ and semi-directed interviews with experimental sciences imagery stakeholders, this inquiry aims at identifying proprieties of the "beautiful image of science", using the notion of "beauty" as a basis to better understand the underlying criteria leading to decision-making in the processes of scientific imagery. This research shows that moments of openness and practices of design are present at certain stages of the imagery workflow, and could be emphasized to encourage exploration for discoveries.
