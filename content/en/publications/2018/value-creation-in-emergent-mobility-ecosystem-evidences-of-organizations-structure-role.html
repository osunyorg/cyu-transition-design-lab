abstract: >-
  It has been widely described that industries have been disrupted by the platformization enabled by digital technologies, and that sectors boundaries are becoming more blurred due to the ecosystem-based dynamic of resource flow (energy, data…). The automotive industry has been widely impacted by the servitization and platformization of their offer (Sumatran et al. 2017), and value capturing involves the consideration of roles to be played in future ecosystems. In the case of nascent ecosystems, different strategies have been identified to navigate such situations and the path to bottleneck position is described as the one enabling the creation and capturing of value (Hannah and Eisenhardt, 2016) But few elements are provided on the relationship between value creation and value proposition definition, and individual characteristics of incumbent firms participating and positioning in nascent ecosystems. The influence of organizations structure on how partners perform during the phase of emergence of an ecosystem has not been investigated. Based on three case studies on mobility infrastructure and service development, the communication investigates how incumbents react to emerging requirements of a nascent ecosystem, and consequently how they progressively contribute to steer their future positioning in such ecosystem. The research highlights that organizational evolutions might take place, but that value creation and ecosystem positioning are influenced by actors’ initial organizational characteristics and its ability to modify them, while being involved in a portfolio of similar innovation projects.
