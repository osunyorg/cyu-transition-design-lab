abstract: >-
  This article elaborates on Schön's model of design to address the material part of the “design conversation.” Bringing in media and mediality studies, our research aims to support a broader understanding of the production of meanings and forms by addressing the difference between materials and mediums. While Schön used both concepts, we show that Dewey's influence on Schön can explain why speaking of mediums as a “system of formation” can better describe the multilayered semiotic working of the material conversation either foregrounding the support and allowing for a bodily experience or foregrounding the message and supporting an interpreting experience.
