abstract: >-
  The deindustrialization along with the emergence of digital technologies are challenging the design discipline. The induced mutations could be enlighten by setting side by side the incidence of postmodernity on design and the impact of Modern times on fine arts. Acknowledging the increasing economic importance taken by the new information and communication technology and the singularity of the work with calculated or service-based materials, we observe an expansion of the design disciplines in two directions. The first one is growing in adherence with the « Agile » development methodologies, the second one is located within projects spaces where challenges are less in defining forms than in facilitating their emergence.
