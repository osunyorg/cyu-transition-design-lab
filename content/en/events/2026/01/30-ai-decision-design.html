    AI & Decision Design
  summary: >-
    <p>A full-day seminar and hands-on workshop to analyze recent AI experiences in decision-making situations, then co-design an AI agent to support a budget decision in a professional context.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>About  <br>   <br>This seminar explores how  generative AI  is used within  decision-making  situations, and how AI agents can be designed to fit organisational contexts (information constraints, responsibilities, evaluation criteria). The day combines introductory talks with a hands-on workshop: participants first analyse recent AI-assisted decision experiences and derive transferable properties of "ideal" AI support. In the afternoon, groups co-design an AI agent to support a budget decision in a professional setting, by formalising its context, resources, capabilities, workflow, constraints, and expected outputs before implementation. </p>  <p> Program  <br>   <br>9:00 – 9:40 : Welcome & workshop introduction <br>Coffee, arrival, and start of the day.
