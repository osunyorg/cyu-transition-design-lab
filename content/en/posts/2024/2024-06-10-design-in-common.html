    <p>  <br>This publication aims to present a contributive approach to design and web development through the methods, tools, and deliverables created for the website and visual identity of the design research laboratory at CY Design School, the Transition Design Lab.Its purpose is to highlight and promote key areas of improvement and relevant reflections for the collective design and development of websites that are efficient, accessible, visually appealing, and functional. In summary, this article explores topics related to contribution and collaboration in design and web development.</p>  <p> From design brief to the choice of an open-Source, free, and eco-designed CMS  <br>   <br>The design process began with defining a design brief that outlined the project's expectations, constraints, and initial input data. This exercise was conducted collaboratively using FigJam, an online whiteboard tool. This was the team's first introduction to the tools and deliverables used by designers. The brief was co-constructed using the VRAP method, a strategic design model created by Praticable (formerly Collectif Bam), designed to cohesively address all key aspects of a project.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>VRAP Method, a strategic design model created by Praticable (formerly Collectif Bam). <br>VRAP, an acronym for Vision, Action, Relation, Perception, is a framework developed to facilitate communication between the client and designer while providing a comprehensive view of the project. The goal of VRAP is to develop the project's strategic (Vision), organizational (Relation), operational (Action), and sensory (Perception) dimensions. <br>  </p>  <p>Capture d'écran du brief VRAP du futur site internet du Transition design lab, réalisé sur FigJam. <br>   <br>For the Transition Design Lab’s website and visual identity project:</p>  <p>Vision encompassed the laboratory’s values and philosophical principles, represented through keywords, along with its communication objectives. The team aimed to convey a serious, collective, and welcoming image.</p>  <p>Relation focused on identifying the key stakeholders and beneficiaries of the project, including researchers, associates, and partner organizations.</p>  <p>Action defined the expected functionalities of the website and visual identity. This stage clarified the choice of CMS (Content Management System).</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Osuny website <br>   <br>The website's administration had to be user-friendly, simple, and aligned with the team’s expectations and technical skills. Additionally, the CMS needed to allow for quick and easy content creation, efficient indexing using tags and internal links, and integration with HAL, a platform for research publications, theses, and articles. Another priority was incorporating a portfolio section to showcase artifacts, digital and non-digital objects produced by the lab.Finally, the team sought a fast-loading website that was minimalist in both aesthetic (visual) and functional (technical) aspects to minimize environmental impact. For all these reasons, the laboratory chose Osuny, an open-source, free, and eco-designed CMS developed by Noesya, a cooperative committed to ethical and aesthetic digital solutions. Additionally, the fact that Osuny is a French CMS developed by a cooperative was another decisive factor in its selection.Notably, Osuny’s Figma file provides an overview of all its components and features. During the Design Brief workshop, the team reviewed Osuny’s design system, available in the Figma community, to verify that the CMS met their needs.</p>  <p>Lastly, the Perception aspect of VRAP focused on the visual and aesthetic choices for the Transition Design Lab. The visual identity had to be serious, clear, didactic, and accessible.

The visual identity had to be serious, clear, didactic, and accessible. Once again, Osuny proved to be the right choice, aligning with the aesthetic requirements of the project.</p>  <p> From moodboards to the visual identity guidelines  <br>   <br>Once the brief was completed and approved, the next step was defining the laboratory’s visual identity. A graphic charter was required for the website, posters, and other materials. To achieve this, two intermediate deliverables were created:</p>  <p>A FigJam file (like the design brief), called Moodboards, used to create visual inspiration boards.</p>  <p>A Figma file named Graphic Research, used to explore and refine the final graphic elements for the lab.</p>  <p> Moodboards </p>  <p>Moodbaords, visual boards created on FigJam. <br> Graphical searches </p>  <p>Validated graphic research.</p>  <p>Previous and rejected graphic searches.</p>  <p>Initial graphic research following the mood boards.</p>  <p>   <br>Once the visual identity was finalized, a graphic charter was officially delivered and continuously refined until the website launch. This document, created in Figma, established the identity’s styles and variables, which were later integrated into the website prototype.The charter included:</p>  <p>Color system (for the website and research programs) with accessibility best practices (AAA contrast standards).</p>  <p>Typography and usage guidelines.</p>  <p>Logo variations and icons.</p>  <p>Compositions and design elements.</p>  <p>Guidelines for image integration (formats, relevance, file size).</p>  <p>Illustrations and external file references (such as graphic research and the website prototype).</p>  <p>A graphic asset folder was also created, updated regularly, and shared with the entire team. This folder contained all graphical exports in various formats (JPG, PNG, SVG).</p>  <p> Graphic charter </p>  <p>   <br>Graphic charter - Transition design lab</p>  <p> From sitemap to high-fidelity prototype  <br>   <br>Alongside the creation of the visual identity, the team worked on the structure of its website. This exercise was also carried out using FigJam, Figma's collaborative whiteboard. Once again, the collaborative nature of online design tools fosters collective work, reduces back-and-forth exchanges, and increases interaction and discussion—unlike email exchanges, for example. Speech, direct and spontaneous exchange, although somewhat degraded by videoconferencing tools, remains essential in design practice. The creation of the website plan, or sitemap in English, was condensed into a few hours of discussion. Once the workshop was completed, the sitemap was validated, with only minor updates made afterward. This workshop format helps frame a project phase and validate the delivery of an intermediate deliverable—the sitemap.</p>  <p> Site map </p>  <p>Final version of the sitemap.</p>  <p>Third version of the sitemap.</p>  <p>Second version of the sitemap.</p>  <p>First version of the site plan based on the brief produced previously.</p>  <p>   <br>The sitemap is a crucial step in website design, addressing both content structuring and indexing. The team defined the main site sections, which are featured in the header, as well as the composition of each page. To complete this mapping work, the team continuously checked their proposals against Osuny’s Figma theme. A necessary back-and-forth between the FigJam sitemap and the Figma design system of the Osuny theme helped validate or refine the site's structure and page composition.With this sitemap in place, content writing could begin. The editorial team produced the site’s texts based on this plan, which was also used to generate the first pages in the administration interface, commonly referred to as the back office. This was made possible as Noesya had deployed the system online a few days earlier. As a result, the editorial team could already insert some content and monitor the development progress. Content and design evolved simultaneously.</p>  <p> Contributing to Osuny’s Design System  <br>In parallel with content creation and website deployment, significant contributions were made to Osuny’s design system to optimize the development of a high-fidelity mockup of the site. This work represents a major contribution to the Osuny project for all designers and developers using this CMS. The objectives of this contribution were multiple.First, the primary challenge was to enhance theme customization by creating and applying variables across all elements. These variables include data related to the theme’s design, such as typographic rules (font, size, weight, letter spacing, line height, etc.), color references, and dimensions (spacing, widths, border radius, screen sizes, etc.). The similarity with CSS variables commonly used in website development is striking. The logic is naturally close, if not identical.Figma even offers a Dev Mode, an inspection tool designed for developers to analyze mockups created by designers. In this mode, the variables defined by designers are available, with naming conventions (e.g., border-radius, padding-bottom, color-primary) largely inspired by developers.</p>  <p> Variables </p>  <p>Collection of "Theme" variables for colors. In the future, the ability to create multiple modes, such as a dark theme and a light theme.</p>  <p>Collection of "Devices" variables for sizes, with two possible modes: Desktop or mobile.</p>  <p>Collection of "Primitive" variables for values. All other collections use these variables.</p>  <p> Aligning Design and Development  <br>Bridging the gap between design and development is a key concern for the team, which aims to further synchronize Figma files with Osuny’s codebase, particularly by aligning variables across both environments.How will this alignment between design and development materialize? Several hypotheses can be considered.</p>  <p>Connecting documents to allow direct site modifications from Figma—similar to Webflow's approach and other comparable tools.</p>  <p>Developing plugins or extensions that generate site code automatically.</p>  <p>Integrating code within Figma to make it a development environment itself.</p>  <p>To what extent can we anticipate a merger between design and development tools? This question remains relevant as design software continues to evolve and introduce new features.</p>  <p> A More Efficient Design-to-Development Process  <br>In summary, the goal of this work is to streamline the design and development of interfaces, minimizing friction between these two phases of the project.Alongside the creation of variables, the Osuny Figma file now includes a comprehensive component library, offering designers a highly accurate UI Kit to control and refine the Osuny design system. These components provide multiple options, closely aligned with the settings available in Osuny’s back office.</p>  <p>Each UI Kit component incorporates variables, styles, variants, and properties. The creation of these components has helped standardize elements, facilitate page construction in Figma, enable visualization, streamline feedback, and allow for quick and easy modifications.</p>  <p> Components </p>  <p>“Block-page” component.</p>  <p>“card-page” subcomponent used for “block-page” components.</p>  <p> From prototype to interface  <br>   <br>It is easy to assume that the generation of these variables will become more seamless in the future. Today, Figma variables can be exported as JSON data. We could imagine connecting this data with the variables of a stylesheet Since then, numerous extensions have been developed to import, export, and manage variables. The friction between design and development is clearly decreasing more and more.</p>  <p>   <br>Once the prototype was completed, it was time to develop the interface. At this stage, the prototype was continuously inspected using Figma's Dev Mode to build the site's code. On the development side, Osuny includes a Sass stylesheet dedicated to variable configuration. The first step of the development process was to modify the available variables in the configuration.sass file.Creating variables is therefore a practice that exists both during the design phase in Figma and during development with stylesheets (CSS, Sass). They are, in fact, very similar—if not identical.</p>  <p> Code </p>  <p>configuration.sass</p>  <p>style.sass</p>  <p>   <br>For the development of our website, a few additional stylesheets were added alongside the configuration.sass file. At the same time, through Osuny's admin interface, the team added the site's content, as prefigured in the Figma prototype. A few weeks later, the website was ready for the official launch of the research chair, The Design of Decision-Making.</p>  <p> Osuny, a digital common for the public interest  <br>Osuny is an open-source content management system that enables the creation of accessible, efficient, high-quality, sovereign, and secure websites.</p>  <p>Discover Osuny <br>https://www.osuny.org/</p>  <p>Learn more about Noesya <br>https://www.noesya.coop/</p>

        <p>Once the visual identity was finalized, a <strong>graphic charter</strong> was officially delivered and continuously refined until the website launch. This document, created in <strong>Figma</strong>, established the identity’s styles and variables, which were later integrated into the website prototype.</p><p>The charter included:</p><ul> <li> <p><strong>Color system</strong> (for the website and research programs) with accessibility best practices (AAA contrast standards).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Typography and usage guidelines</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Logo variations and icons</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Compositions and design elements</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Guidelines for image integration</strong> (formats, relevance, file size).</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Illustrations and external file references</strong> (such as graphic research and the website prototype).</p> </li> </ul><p>   </p><p>A <strong>graphic asset folder</strong> was also created, updated regularly, and shared with the entire team.

        <p><strong>Alongside the creation of the visual identity, the team worked on the structure of its website.</strong> This exercise was also carried out using FigJam, Figma's collaborative whiteboard. Once again, the collaborative nature of online design tools fosters collective work, reduces back-and-forth exchanges, and increases interaction and discussion—unlike email exchanges, for example. Speech, direct and spontaneous exchange, although somewhat degraded by videoconferencing tools, remains essential in design practice. The creation of the website plan, or <strong>sitemap</strong> in English, was condensed into a few hours of discussion. Once the workshop was completed, the sitemap was validated, with only minor updates made afterward. This workshop format helps frame a project phase and validate the delivery of an intermediate deliverable—the sitemap.</p>

        <p>The <strong>sitemap</strong> is a crucial step in website design, addressing both content structuring and indexing. The team defined the main site sections, which are featured in the header, as well as the composition of each page. To complete this mapping work, the team continuously checked their proposals against Osuny’s Figma theme. A necessary back-and-forth between the <strong>FigJam sitemap</strong> and the <strong>Figma design system</strong> of the Osuny theme helped validate or refine the site's structure and page composition.</p><p>With this sitemap in place, content writing could begin. The editorial team produced the site’s texts based on this plan, which was also used to generate the first pages in the administration interface, commonly referred to as the <strong>back office</strong>. This was made possible as Noesya had deployed the system online a few days earlier. As a result, the editorial team could already insert some content and monitor the development progress. Content and design evolved simultaneously.</p>

        <p>In parallel with content creation and website deployment, significant contributions were made to Osuny’s <strong>design system</strong> to optimize the development of a high-fidelity mockup of the site. This work represents a major contribution to the Osuny project for all designers and developers using this CMS. The objectives of this contribution were multiple.</p><p>First, the primary challenge was to enhance <strong>theme customization</strong> by creating and applying <strong>variables</strong> across all elements. These variables include data related to the theme’s design, such as <strong>typographic rules</strong> (font, size, weight, letter spacing, line height, etc.), <strong>color references</strong>, and <strong>dimensions</strong> (spacing, widths, border radius, screen sizes, etc.). The similarity with CSS variables commonly used in website development is striking. The logic is naturally close, if not identical.</p><p>Figma even offers a <strong>Dev Mode</strong>, an inspection tool designed for developers to analyze mockups created by designers. In this mode, the variables defined by designers are available, with naming conventions (e.g., <strong>border-radius</strong>, <strong>padding-bottom</strong>, <strong>color-primary</strong>) largely inspired by developers.</p>

These components provide multiple options, closely aligned with the settings available in Osuny’s back office.</p><p>  </p><p>Each UI Kit component incorporates <strong>variables, styles, variants, and properties</strong>. The creation of these components has helped <strong>standardize elements</strong>, facilitate page construction in Figma, enable visualization, streamline feedback, and allow for quick and easy modifications.</p>

        <p>It is easy to assume that the generation of these variables will become more seamless in the future. Today, Figma variables can be exported as JSON data. We could imagine connecting this data with the variables of a stylesheet <span class="note" role="note"><span class="note__call" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Lire la note 1">1</span><span class="note__content" aria-hidden="true" aria-live="polite">Since then, numerous extensions have been developed to import, export, and manage variables. The friction between design and development is clearly decreasing more and more</span></span>.</p>

        <p>Once the prototype was completed, it was time to develop the interface. At this stage, the prototype was continuously inspected using Figma's Dev Mode to build the site's code. On the development side, Osuny includes a Sass stylesheet dedicated to variable configuration. The first step of the development process was to modify the available variables in the configuration.sass file.<br><br>Creating variables is therefore a practice that exists both during the design phase in Figma and during development with stylesheets (CSS, Sass). They are, in fact, very similar—if not identical.</p>

        <p>For the development of our website, a few additional stylesheets were added alongside the configuration.sass file. At the same time, through Osuny's admin interface, the team added the site's content, as prefigured in the Figma prototype. A few weeks later, the website was ready for the official launch of the research chair, <em><a href="https://transitiondesign.labo.cyu.fr/en/programs/decision-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Design of Decision-Making <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a>.</em></p>
