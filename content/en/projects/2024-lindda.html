    <p>LINDDA: Living INfrastructure to Design responsible Digital technology for Agroecological transition, aims to understand the design modalities in place or needed for digitally-supported agro-ecological transitions.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>LINDDA is a targeted research project under the "Agroecology and digital technology" Priority Research Programs and Equipment (PEPR) initiative, piloted by INRAE and INRIA. LINDDA has been awarded the contract "ANR-22-PEAE-0004" dated February 10, 2023 for 5 years.</p>  <p> About  <br>   <br>LINDDA is a multidisciplinary project bringing together design (CY Ecole de design and LPI), engineering (Inrae and Inria), ergonomics (Cnam), humanities and social sciences, with the aim of identifying, qualifying and testing infrastructures to support responsible digital design for the agroecological transition.The hypothesis posed by LINDDA is that the agroecological transition depends on design infrastructures with "living" characteristics, which are to be qualified.These infrastructures, as defined by STS (Science and Technology Studies) Star (1999) Bowker et al. (1997) Edwards et al. (2007)  articulate systems and sites, depend on conventions of use and socio-technical norms, and develop and evolve incrementally.Therefore, by bringing together environmental and systemic design issues Jones (2014) Bornes (2023)  that take into account heterogeneous technical systems and social and cultural practices in very different professional and organizational environments, LINDDA aims to  <br>  <br> consolidate these evolving transition infrastructures , which articulate and think together symbols, things and actions (see figures below);  <br>  <br> facilitate coupled innovations Meynard et al. (2017)   by coordinating innovation players to tackle social, technological and environmental problems together;  <br>  <br> encourage the scaling-up  of often local practices by overcoming silos between actors, systems and sites.  <br> These objectives require the development of interdisciplinary design and research resources to ensure the transformation of existing innovation infrastructures (such as Living Labs) and the emergence of new ones.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Justine Peneau <br>Diagram of the four order of design based on Buchanan (1991) <br>  </p>  <p>Justine Peneau <br>Diagram of infrastructure components that play a role in framing transitions. The diagram highlights the importance of thinking in terms of the 4 orders of design when addressing transition issues. <br> WP2 : Developing a design research plateform  <br>   <br>Alongside the Learning Planet Institut, the Transition design lab is in charge of developing a design research platform to observe, categorize, design and test new responsible digital design devices for the agroecological transition.Drawing on two fields: the  Occitanum living lab  and the participatory consultation project concerning the energy policy and water management of the  PETR Briançonnais, Ecrins et Guillestrois Queyras , we are carrying out the following tasks:  <br> describe and analyze the media (documents and channels of circulation of these documents) that are mobilized in different situations (design, engagement, communication, learning, decision-making) to understand the role they play in infrastructuring the design of a responsible digital for agroecology.  <br> evaluate, select and categorize appropriate design methods for responsible digital design for the agroecological transition.  <br> design and test infrastructuring devices: design appropriate intermediate objects for responsible digital agriculture supporting agroecological transitions.  </p>  <p> Program members  <br>  </p>  <p>Co-head</p>  <p>Post-doctoral researcher</p>  <p> Partners  </p>
