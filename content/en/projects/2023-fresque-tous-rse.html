        <p>The "fresque tous RSE" is a workshop built to help employees build a CSR action plan. </p><p>Through three steps, they learn more about the global stakes of our planet, through environnemental and social challenges. The tool aims to raise awareness and empower people by giving them examples of actions they can do in their organisation.</p><p>The co-construction of the “all CSR fresco” takes place in 3 stages:<br></p><ol> <li> <b>Global stakes : environnemental and social challenges.</b> This step is about visualizing biodiversity and climate challenges, and linking them to the great social inequalities that are embeded in our human society. </li> <li> <b>Systemic view of society and CSR. </b>This step is about showing the links between public authorities, organisations, and individual citizens. Visualizing these links emphasizes the responsability that falls into each scale of society.</li> <li> <b>Corporate actions. </b>This step is about showing the employees what is already happening in their organisation. The goal is to encourage them to take action in their team, and to build a stronger transition network throughout the whole organisation. </li> </ol>
