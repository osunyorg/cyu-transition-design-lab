        <p>Design practices  have  developed within the relatively homogeneous framework of business. All methodologies - from industrial design to design thinking - have been conceived for and by organizations that produce artifacts and services meanwhile following a certain decision-making process. However, ecological and social crises are forcing organizations to rethink their strategies, and in particular their capacity for adaptation, invention, improvisation and coalition. To cope, companies need to cooperate with new players (citizens, local authorities, associations, cooperatives, States). Design is therefore faced with new decision-making and legitimization processes within organizations (CSR, mission-driven companies) and between organizations (innovation platforms) that radically change how it operates.</p>
