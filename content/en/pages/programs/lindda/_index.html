    <p>LINDDA: Living INfrastructure to Design responsible Digital technology for Agroecological transition, aims to understand the design modalities in place or needed for digitally-supported agro-ecological transitions.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>LINDDA is a targeted research project under the "Agroecology and digital <br> technology" Priority Research Programs and Equipment (PEPR) initiative, <br> piloted by INRAE and INRIA. LINDDA has been awarded the contract  <br>"ANR-22-PEAE-0004" dated February 10, 2023 for 5 years.</p>  <p> About LINDDA  <br>   <br>LINDDA is a multidisciplinary project bringing together design (CY Ecole de design and LPI), engineering (Inrae and Inria), ergonomics (Cnam), humanities and social sciences, with the aim of identifying, qualifying and testing infrastructures to support responsible digital design for the agroecological transition.The hypothesis posed by LINDDA is that the agroecological transition depends on design infrastructures with "living" characteristics, which are to be qualified.These infrastructures, as defined by STS (Science and Technology Studies)[1][2][3] articulate systems and sites, depend on conventions of use and socio-technical norms, and develop and evolve incrementally.Therefore, by bringing together environmental and systemic design issues[4][5] that take into account heterogeneous technical systems and social and cultural practices in very different professional and organizational environments, LINDDA aims to</p>  <p>consolidate these evolving transition infrastructures, which articulate and think together symbols, things and actions (see figures below);</p>  <p>facilitate coupled innovations[6] by coordinating innovation players to tackle social, technological and environmental problems together;</p>  <p>encourage the scaling-up of often local practices by overcoming silos between actors, systems and sites. <br>These objectives require the development of interdisciplinary design and research resources to ensure the transformation of existing innovation infrastructures (such as Living Labs) and the emergence of new ones.  <br>References[1]Star (1999), [2]Bowker et al.
