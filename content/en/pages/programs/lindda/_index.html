        <p>LINDDA is a multidisciplinary project bringing together design (CY Ecole de design and LPI), engineering (Inrae and Inria), ergonomics (Cnam), humanities and social sciences, with the aim of identifying, qualifying and testing infrastructures to support responsible digital design for the agroecological transition.</p><p>The hypothesis posed by LINDDA is that the agroecological transition depends on design infrastructures with "living" characteristics, which are to be qualified.</p><p>These infrastructures, as defined by STS (Science and Technology Studies)<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> articulate systems and sites, depend on conventions of use and socio-technical norms, and develop and evolve incrementally.</p><p>Therefore, by bringing together environmental and systemic design issues<sup>[4][5]</sup> that take into account heterogeneous technical systems and social and cultural practices in very different professional and organizational environments, LINDDA aims to</p><ul>  <li>  <b>consolidate these evolving transition infrastructures</b>, which articulate and think together symbols, things and actions (see figures below);</li>  <li>  <b>facilitate coupled innovations</b><sup>[6]</sup> by coordinating innovation players to tackle social, technological and environmental problems together;</li>  <li>  <b>encourage the scaling-up</b> of often local practices by overcoming silos between actors, systems and sites.</li>  </ul><p>These objectives require the development of interdisciplinary design and research resources to ensure the transformation of existing innovation infrastructures (such as Living Labs) and the emergence of new ones. <br></p>

        <p>Alongside the Learning Planet Institut, the Transition design lab is in charge of developing a design research platform to observe, categorize, design and test new responsible digital design devices for the agroecological transition.</p><p>Drawing on two fields: the <a href="https://occitanum.fr/" target="_blank">Occitanum living lab</a> and the participatory consultation project concerning the energy policy and water management of the <a href="https://www.paysgrandbrianconnais.fr/concertation-politique-energetique" target="_blank">PETR Briançonnais, Ecrins et Guillestrois Queyras</a>, we are carrying out the following tasks:</p><ul>  <li>describe and analyze the media (documents and channels of circulation of these documents) that are mobilized in different situations (design, engagement, communication, learning, decision-making) to understand the role they play in infrastructuring the design of a responsible digital for agroecology.</li>  <li>evaluate, select and categorize appropriate design methods for responsible digital design for the agroecological transition.</li>  <li>design and test infrastructuring devices: design appropriate intermediate objects for responsible digital agriculture supporting agroecological transitions.  <br>  </li>  </ul>
