    <p>More about our value:  <br>  <br> Benevolence : we work closely together to take advantage of all intelligences and sensitivities. We want our lab to be a benevolent space [1] .  <br>  <br> Curiosity : we want to find new synergies with academic, industrial, associative, public and private organizations. Following the philosopher of science Anne-Françoise Schmid’s concept of under-determination [2][3] , we import elements from scientific disciplines to support new theoretical insights in design. This is how we put the in-discipline of design into practice! [4]  <br>  <br>  <br> Futurism : We are resolutely focused on the future that we want to build [5][6][7][8] . We are interested in the challenges of our contemporary world and we want to do some research that will matter for the future. We are also a school, and we are driven by the questions asked by our students!  <br>  <br> Rigor : our goal is to contribute to international research in transition design and systemic design with a focus on material cultures and designing operations. </p>  <p>[1] Belin (2015),   [2] Chrysos & Gentès (2019),  [3] Schmid (1998),  [4] Gentes (2017) ,  [5] Agazzi (2012),  [6] Amar (2013),  [7] Bryant & Knight (2019),  [8] Schmid & Mambrini-Doudet (2019)</p>
