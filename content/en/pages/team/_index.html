        <ul> <li> <b>Benevolence</b>: we work closely together to take advantage of all intelligences and sensitivities. We want our lab to be a benevolent space<sup>[1]</sup>.</li> <li> <b>Curiosity</b>: we want to find new synergies with academic, industrial, associative, public and private organizations. Following the philosopher of science Anne-Françoise Schmid’s concept of under-determination<sup>[2][3]</sup>, we import elements from scientific disciplines to support new theoretical insights in design. This is how we put the in-discipline of design into practice!<sup>[4]</sup><br> </li> <li> <b>Futurism</b>: We are resolutely focused on the future that we want to build<sup>[5][6][7][8]</sup>. We are interested in the challenges of our contemporary world and we want to do some research that will matter for the future. We are also a school, and we are driven by the questions asked by our students!</li> <li> <b>Rigor</b>: our goal is to contribute to international research in transition design and systemic design with a focus on material cultures and designing operations.</li> </ul>
