    <p>Laboratory  <br> Mission  <br>Transition Design Lab research relies both on design studies and design science. Focusing on transition paradigme, we recognize three major challenges for design practices:  <br> The change in geographical scale;  <br> The heterogeneity of actors and their interests;  <br>  <br> The introduction of long-term regeneration issues.   <br>  <br> Those challenges lead us to identify, in a multidisciplinary litterature review, five crucial dimensions to design for socio-environmental transitions.</p>  <p> Values  <br>  <br> Benevolence : we work closely together to take advantage of all intelligences and sensitivities. We want our lab to be a benevolent space Belin (2015) .  <br>  <br> Curiosity : we want to find new synergies with academic, industrial, associative, public and private organizations. Following the philosopher of science Anne-Françoise Schmid's concept of under-determination Anne-Françoise Schmid Chrysos & Gentès (2019) Schmid (1998) , we import elements from scientific disciplines to support new theoretical insights in design. This is how we put the in-discipline of design into practice! Gentes (2017) .  <br>  <br> Futurism : We are resolutely focused on the future that we want to build Agazzi (2012) Amar (2013) Bryant & Knight (2019) Schmid & Mambrini-Doudet (2019) . We are interested in the challenges of our contemporary world and we want to do some research that will matter for the future. We are also a school, and we are driven by the questions asked by our students!  <br>  <br> Rigor : our goal is to contribute to international research in transition design and systemic design with a focus on material cultures and designing operations. </p>  <p> Community </p>  <p> Transition design  <br> 5 dimensions of Transition design  <br>5 dimensions of design of transitions diagram <br>Anthony Ferretti, Annie Gentès et Justine Peneau</p>  <p> Vizualizing / Monitoring  <br>How can we inform stakeholders about the current and evolving state of  <br>the systems in which they live, and on which they can rely (what is  <br>already in place, what works) or which they want to remedy (what needs  <br>to be changed)?</p>  <p>   <br>Design <br>research focus  <br> The research focuses as much on <br>system representations as on design methodologies. We analyze and design representations and <br>visualizations of systems in their current state for heterogeneous <br>audiences and a diversity of purposes: data visualization, <br>information vizualizations, systemic design Blomkamp (2022)  and meta <br>design Giaccardi & Fischer (2008) Sevaldson (2013) Allee (2008) Haraldsson (2004) .</p>  <p> Engaging  <br>How <br>ecological and societal awareness can take hold and spread? Who are <br>the  "concerned" Peneau (2023)  ? How capturate and <br>maintain their attention ? What supports sustainable behaviors ?</p>  <p>   <br>Design <br>research focus  <br> We need to dentify the new <br>entrants, human and non-human Favret-Saada (1977) Favret-Saada (2009) Latour (2017) , and their roles in <br>decision-making Latour (2018) Karana et al. (2020) . We investigate the issues of <br>opinion leadership and influence with a focus on actors as well as <br>media Rogers & Cartano (1962) Roger (1983) Flynn &Goldsmith (1996) Valente & Pumpuang (2007) Akrich et al. (2002) . We design and organize new formats of engagement and <br>feedback: nudge Thaler & Sunstein (2009) Ölander & Thøgersen (2014) , positive reinforcement and <br>gamification theory, engagement management Andriof et al. (2017) , etc.</p>  <p> Debating  <br> Elaborating on participatory design, how can we design for fruitful <br>debates and decision making processes involving a heterogeneous range <br>of "concerned" parties ? How do we design debate <br>modalities Gentes & Mollon (2015) Bonaccorsi & julliard (2012) ? </p>  <p>   <br> Design research focus We need to <br>understand and identify all forms of debating situations involving <br>different "concerned" actors, in different places, at <br>different time, by different modalities and with different media. We <br>analyse debating situations and design tools, intefaces and media to <br>support the configuration of a fruitful debate : stakeholders <br>mapping Reed et al. (2009) , contreversy mapping Venturini (2010) , representativeness and governance <br>formats Berthet & Hickey (2018) , to ensure the material and human conditions for a fair <br>debate Umney & Lloyd (2018) Meadowcroft (2009) Gentes & Perez (2022)  and to support closure and the moving on to <br>decisions : rethink negociation and voting methods (e.g. <br>quadratic voting Lalley & Weyl (2018) ).</p>  <p> Forecasting  <br>What <br>are the tools and media that enable heterogeneous audiences to <br>project themselves intimately and collectively into possible <br>futures ?</p>  <p>   <br>Design <br>research focus The research focuses <br>as much on the pragmatic caracteristics of projecting media and tools <br>as on their ideological, teleological and dramaturgical effects on <br>actors and collectives. We identify the best practices Sio et al. (2015)  and the potential of each media and tool for reproductibility and <br>scalability in different contexts, as much as alignement spaces that <br>organize flows and this scaling Tura et al. (2018) Marcocchia (2019)  among a large range of <br>practices: code scenarios Bornes et al. (2022) , representation tools of imaginaries <br>and projection to choose possible futures Young et al. (2001) Gentes (2008) Heinonen & Hiltunen (2012) Gentes (2015)  such as <br>frescoes,  foresight narratives co-created with AI, simulation design <br>tools from weak emerence to strong emergence Gentes (2008) , etc.</p>  <p> Backcasting  <br> How <br>to draw up an action plan with tools for evaluating the stages and <br>the values and impacts created? What are the media, <br>communication situations and actors likely to define and implement <br>desirable futures? </p>  <p>   <br>Design <br>research focus The research focuses on the <br>nature of KPIs and designs evaluation interfaces, accounting <br>instruments, dashboards for activities. We critically question, analyze <br>and design evaluation methodologies: criteria, values Sterman (2001) Rodriguez et al. (2019) . We <br>identify the actors and resources needed Ostenwalder & Pigneur (2010)  to counter the obstacles <br>to the desired future. We identify the stages of organizational <br>transformation based on the dimensions of organization design Galbraith & Kates (2010) .</p>  <p> Design model  <br> AMC : Actors, Mediums, Cultures  <br>Mediums / Actors / Culture design model diagram <br>Anthony Ferretti, Annie Gentès et Justine Peneau <br>This diagram represents the three spaces involved in design, the dynamics and operations of design among those three spaces : médiums space, actors space and culture space. <br>   <br>All <br>our research is based on the AMC model (Actors/Mediums/Cultures). Based on media studies the AMC model allows us to analyse the <br>material culture of design milieu from an anthropological standpoint. <br>In particular, we focus on the informational literacies and <br>communicational infrastructures that support the mediation between <br>actors in transition. We also analyze how artefacts and actors “work <br>together” to achieve innovative goals. Thus, the  Actors / Mediums / Cultures model  studies design <br>activities as both tangible and symbolic operations between actors, <br>media and cultures. It highlights:  <br> the fundamental role of the <br>	"mediums" of conception, debate and decision;  <br> the specificities of the actors’ cultures (aesthetics, <br>	social and political values, and modes of legitimization). </p>  <p> A design model based on media studies  <br>Drawing <br>on Dewey Dewey (1934)  and Schön Schön (1983) , our model is media-centric, i.e. it starts <br>from a definition of the media as material, medium and mediation. <br>Mediums enable designers to distance themselves Guillory (2010) , to engage in a <br>"conversation" with materials Schön (1992) , to project imaginaries, <br>to support embodied activity and to make sense of the history of <br>their uses Gentes & Marcocchia (2023) . We see design mediums as formative matrices Gentes (2022)  that give rise to <br>possibilities based on both material and symbolic properties, and the <br>designers' gestures and imagination.</p>  <p> A design model based on a specific theory of "culture"  <br>AMC design model is based on a theory of  culture as a design <br>environment , but also as a  creative mediation between the inner <br>self and the outside world .  <br>  <br> Culture as a design environment:  Every design activity takes place in a milieu Despret (2012)  that presents the <br>elements of a problem and provides the resources for solutions. The <br>design project is therefore considered as a situated cultural <br>activity. We use anthropology of material cultures and media studies to <br>focus on the mediums (tangible, symbolic) of design and what they <br>make designers do.  <br>  <br> Culture as mediation between self and the word:  Culture is also an intermediary space between the inner self (the <br>human capacity to project imaginary worlds), and the outside <br>world Winnicott (1971) . Within culture, we can attribute new meanings to things and <br>follow these projections to design new artifacts, situations, <br>relations. As a cultural activity, design is not only a rational <br>practice that optimizes its means for certain ends, but also as an <br>exercise in imagination and fiction Gentes (2024) . Fiction takes the form of a <br>"concept", as in CK theory Hatchuel et al. (2003) , a narrative Gentes (2017)  or any other <br>form of exploration of values, materials and languages.  <br> </p>  <p> AMC Design model: a theory of actors and design activities  <br>Design <br>practices are analyzed as operations that organize a playful <br>interaction Winnicott (1971)  between actors, malleable mediums Gentes (2024) Roussillon (2001)  and <br>cultures :  <br> </p>  <p>  <br> We observe what operations help designers defix from cultural <br>habits and representations . Culture here is considered as an <br>anthropological background that is challenged by design activities.  <br>  <br> We study how actors extract resources and how they mobilize and <br>manipulate these resources through operations of framing, <br>discretization, composition, addition and substraction.  Culture <br>here is considered as a projective, imaginary, cognitive and embodied <br>activity of designers who “play” with the mediums at hand.  <br>  <br> We are interested in how designers anticipate the ways in which <br>alternative solutions are appropriated by the actors and we analyze <br>operations of mediation, teaching, legitimization, influence.  Culture <br>is considered as the milieu that is re-organized by the solution.  <br>  <br> AMC Design model thus emphasizes the media literaties of actors in <br>both production and reception.</p>  <p> AMC: a methodology to understand and develop new design practices  <br>Drawing <br>on media studies and semiotics, we analyze the tools of expression, <br>mediation, narratives and data visualization and culture, documentary <br>formats and mediums of expression that enable actors to take a <br>reflexive and creative step back collectively Gentes & Marcocchia (2023) . In addition, we <br>implement an anthropological analysis of material cultures, design, <br>consultation, and decision-making rituals, as reservoirs of <br>inspiration for designers. Finally, we study the operations of <br>extraction, discretization, composition and expansion that actors use <br>to transform their environments in a sustainable way. The AMC design model allows us to </p>  <p>  <br> study the meaning of “things” and mediums through <br>semio-pragmatic and technical analyses. We look at how things and <br>mediums embed values, beliefs, rationalities that define certain <br>cultures.  <br> conduct ethnographic enquiries that address the interactions <br>of things – living and non living- and people. We are mostly <br>interested in the operations (framing, extraction, discretization, <br>composition, etc.) supported by pliable mediums Gentes (2024) .  <br> look for design spaces that have not been explored and could <br>solve issues. This stage uses interdisciplinarity as a means to find <br>other situations, concepts, theories that underdetermine design <br>beliefs and practices and bring new perspectives.  <br> design, experiment and evaluate artefacts with the <br>stakeholders. </p>  <p> To go further  <br> Website and graphic design </p>  <p> Tools </p>  <p> Research programs </p>  <p>   <br>You want to work with us ?</p>  <p>Contact us <br>mailto:annie.gentes@cyu.fr</p>

        <p>All our research is based on the AMC model (Actors/Mediums/Cultures). Based on media studies the AMC model allows us to analyse the material culture of design milieu from an anthropological standpoint. In particular, we focus on the informational literacies and communicational infrastructures that support the mediation between actors in transition. We also analyze how artefacts and actors “work together” to achieve innovative goals.</p><p>Thus, the <i>Actors / Mediums / Cultures model</i> studies design activities as both tangible and symbolic operations between actors, media and cultures. It highlights:</p><ul> <li>the fundamental role of the 	"mediums" of conception, debate and decision;</li> <li>the specificities of the actors’ cultures (aesthetics, 	social and political values, and modes of legitimization).</li> </ul>

        <p>AMC design model is based on a theory of <b>culture as a design environment</b>, but also as a <b>creative mediation between the inner self and the outside world</b>.</p><ol> <li> <b>Culture as a design environment:</b> Every design activity takes place in a milieu <span class="note" role="note"><span class="note__call" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Lire la note 56">56</span><span class="note__content" aria-hidden="true" aria-live="polite">Despret (2012)</span></span> that presents the elements of a problem and provides the resources for solutions. The design project is therefore considered as a situated cultural activity. We use anthropology of material cultures and media studies to focus on the mediums (tangible, symbolic) of design and what they make designers do.</li> <li> <b>Culture as mediation between self and the word: </b>Culture is also an intermediary space between the inner self (the human capacity to project imaginary worlds), and the outside world <span class="note" role="note"><span class="note__call" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Lire la note 57">57</span><span class="note__content" aria-hidden="true" aria-live="polite">Winnicott (1971)</span></span>.

        <p>Drawing on media studies and semiotics, we analyze the tools of expression, mediation, narratives and data visualization and culture, documentary formats and mediums of expression that enable actors to take a reflexive and creative step back collectively <span class="note" role="note"><span class="note__call" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Lire la note 64">64</span><span class="note__content" aria-hidden="true" aria-live="polite">Gentes & Marcocchia (2023)</span></span>. In addition, we implement an anthropological analysis of material cultures, design, consultation, and decision-making rituals, as reservoirs of inspiration for designers. Finally, we study the operations of extraction, discretization, composition and expansion that actors use to transform their environments in a sustainable way.</p><p>The AMC design model allows us to</p><p>    </p><ul> <li>study the meaning of “things” and mediums through semio-pragmatic and technical analyses. We look at how things and mediums embed values, beliefs, rationalities that define certain cultures.</li> <li>conduct ethnographic enquiries that address the interactions of things – living and non living- and people. We are mostly interested in the operations (framing, extraction, discretization, composition, etc.) supported by pliable mediums <span class="note" role="note"><span class="note__call" role="button" tabindex="0" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Lire la note 65">65</span><span class="note__content" aria-hidden="true" aria-live="polite">Gentes (2024)</span></span>.</li> <li>look for design spaces that have not been explored and could solve issues. This stage uses interdisciplinarity as a means to find other situations, concepts, theories that underdetermine design beliefs and practices and bring new perspectives.</li> <li>design, experiment and evaluate artefacts with the stakeholders.</li> </ul>
