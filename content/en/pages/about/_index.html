    <p>  <br>Transition Design Lab research relies both on design studies and design science. Focusing on transition paradigme, we recognize three major challenges for design practices:  <br> the change in geographical scale;  <br> the heterogeneity of actors and their interests;  <br> the introduction of long-term regeneration issues.   <br>  <br> Those challenges lead us to identify, in a multidisciplinary litterature review, five crucial dimensions to design for socio-environmental transitions.</p>  <p> The 5 Dimensions of Transition Design  <br>   <br>5 dimensions of design of transitions diagram <br>Anthony Ferretti, Annie Gentès et Justine Peneau <br>This diagram presents the 5 dimensions of design of transitions. <br> Vizualizing / Monitoring  <br>How can we inform stakeholders about the current and evolving state of  <br>the systems in which they live, and on which they can rely (what is  <br>already in place, what works) or which they want to remedy (what needs  <br>to be changed)?</p>  <p>   <br>Design <br>research focus  <br> The research focuses as much on <br>system representations as on design methodologies.

We critically question, analyze <br>and design evaluation methodologies: criteria, values [1][2] . We <br>identify the actors and resources needed [3]  to counter the obstacles <br>to the desired future. We identify the stages of organizational <br>transformation based on the dimensions of organization design [4] . <br>References  <br> [1] Sterman (2001),  [2] Rodriguez et al. (2019),  [3] Ostenwalder & <br>Pigneur (2010),  [4] Galbraith & Kates (2010)</p>  <p> The "Actors / Mediums / Cultures" Design model (AMC)  <br>   <br>Mediums / Actors / Culture design model diagram <br>Anthony Ferretti, Annie Gentès et Justine Peneau <br>This diagram represents the three spaces involved in design, the dynamics and operations of design among those three spaces : médiums space, actors space and culture space. <br>   <br>All <br>our research is based on the AMC model (Actors/Mediums/Cultures). Based on media studies the AMC model allows us to analyse the <br>material culture of design milieu from an anthropological standpoint. <br>In particular, we focus on the informational literacies and <br>communicational infrastructures that support the mediation between <br>actors in transition. We also analyze how artefacts and actors “work <br>together” to achieve innovative goals. Thus, the  Actors / Mediums / Cultures model  studies design <br>activities as both tangible and symbolic operations between actors, <br>media and cultures. It highlights:  <br>  <br> the fundamental role of the <br>	"mediums" of conception, debate and decision;  <br>	  <br>  <br> the specificities of the actors’ cultures (aesthetics, <br>	social and political values, and modes of legitimization).  <br> </p>  <p> A design model based on media studies  <br>Drawing <br>on Dewey [1]  and Schön [2] , our model is media-centric, i.e. it starts <br>from a definition of the media as material, medium and mediation. <br>Mediums enable designers to distance themselves [3] , to engage in a <br>"conversation" with materials [4] , to project imaginaries, <br>to support embodied activity and to make sense of the history of <br>their uses [5] . We see design mediums as formative matrices [6]  that give rise to <br>possibilities based on both material and symbolic properties, and the <br>designers' gestures and imagination.</p>  <p> A design model based on a specific theory of "culture"  <br>AMC design model is based on a theory of  culture as a design <br>environment , but also as a  creative mediation between the inner <br>self and the outside world .  <br>  <br> Culture as a design environment:  Every design activity takes place in a milieu [7]  that presents the <br>elements of a problem and provides the resources for solutions. The <br>design project is therefore considered as a situated cultural <br>activity. We use anthropology of material cultures and media studies to <br>focus on the mediums (tangible, symbolic) of design and what they <br>make designers do.  <br>  <br> Culture as mediation between self and the word:  Culture is also an intermediary space between the inner self (the <br>human capacity to project imaginary worlds), and the outside <br>world [8] . Within culture, we can attribute new meanings to things and <br>follow these projections to design new artifacts, situations, <br>relations. As a cultural activity, design is not only a rational <br>practice that optimizes its means for certain ends, but also as an <br>exercise in imagination and fiction [9] . Fiction takes the form of a <br>"concept", as in CK theory [10] , a narrative [11] or any other <br>form of exploration of values, materials and languages.  <br> </p>  <p> AMC Design model: a theory of actors and design activities  <br>Design <br>practices are analyzed as operations that organize a playful <br>interaction [8]  between actors, malleable mediums [9][12]  and <br>cultures :  <br> </p>  <p>  <br> We observe what operations help designers defix from cultural <br>habits and representations . Culture here is considered as an <br>anthropological background that is challenged by design activities.  <br>  <br> We study how actors extract resources and how they mobilize and <br>manipulate these resources through operations of framing, <br>discretization, composition, addition and substraction.  Culture <br>here is considered as a projective, imaginary, cognitive and embodied <br>activity of designers who “play” with the mediums at hand.  <br>  <br> We are interested in how designers anticipate the ways in which <br>alternative solutions are appropriated by the actors and we analyze <br>operations of mediation, teaching, legitimization, influence.  Culture <br>is considered as the milieu that is re-organized by the solution.  <br>  <br> AMC Design model thus emphasizes the media literaties of actors in <br>both production and reception.</p>  <p> AMC: a methodology to understand and develop new design practices  <br>Drawing <br>on media studies and semiotics, we analyze the tools of expression, <br>mediation, narratives and data visualization and culture, documentary <br>formats and mediums of expression that enable actors to take a <br>reflexive and creative step back collectively [5] . In addition, we <br>implement an anthropological analysis of material cultures, design, <br>consultation, and decision-making rituals, as reservoirs of <br>inspiration for designers. Finally, we study the operations of <br>extraction, discretization, composition and expansion that actors use <br>to transform their environments in a sustainable way. The AMC design model allows us to </p>  <p>  <br> study the meaning of “things” and mediums through <br>semio-pragmatic and technical analyses. We look at how things and <br>mediums embed values, beliefs, rationalities that define certain <br>cultures.  <br> conduct ethnographic enquiries that address the interactions <br>of things – living and non living- and people. We are mostly <br>interested in the operations (framing, extraction, discretization, <br>composition, etc.) supported by pliable mediums [9] .  <br> look for design spaces that have not been explored and could <br>solve issues. This stage uses interdisciplinarity as a means to find <br>other situations, concepts, theories that underdetermine design <br>beliefs and practices and bring new perspectives.  <br> design, experiment and evaluate artefacts with the <br>stakeholders. </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>References [1]Dewey (1934), [2]Schön (1983), [3]Guillory (2010), [4]Schön <br>(1992), [5]Gentes & Marcocchia (2023), [6]Gentes (2022), <br>[7]Despret (2012), [8]Winnicott (1971), [9]Gentes (2024), <br>[10]Hatchuel et al.

        <p>All our research is based on the AMC model (Actors/Mediums/Cultures). Based on media studies the AMC model allows us to analyse the material culture of design milieu from an anthropological standpoint. In particular, we focus on the informational literacies and communicational infrastructures that support the mediation between actors in transition. We also analyze how artefacts and actors “work together” to achieve innovative goals.</p><p>Thus, the <i>Actors / Mediums / Cultures model</i> studies design activities as both tangible and symbolic operations between actors, media and cultures. It highlights:</p><ul> <li> <p>the fundamental role of the 	"mediums" of conception, debate and decision;</p> 	</li> <li> <p>the specificities of the actors’ cultures (aesthetics, 	social and political values, and modes of legitimization).</p> </li> </ul>

        <p>Drawing on Dewey<sup>[1]</sup> and Schön<sup>[2]</sup>, our model is media-centric, i.e. it starts from a definition of the media as material, medium and mediation. Mediums enable designers to distance themselves<sup>[3]</sup>, to engage in a "conversation" with materials<sup>[4]</sup>, to project imaginaries, to support embodied activity and to make sense of the history of their uses<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>We see design mediums as formative matrices<sup>[6]</sup> that give rise to possibilities based on both material and symbolic properties, and the designers' gestures and imagination.</p>

        <p>AMC design model is based on a theory of <b>culture as a design environment</b>, but also as a <b>creative mediation between the inner self and the outside world</b>.</p><ol> <li> <b>Culture as a design environment:</b> Every design activity takes place in a milieu<sup>[7]</sup> that presents the elements of a problem and provides the resources for solutions. The design project is therefore considered as a situated cultural activity. We use anthropology of material cultures and media studies to focus on the mediums (tangible, symbolic) of design and what they make designers do.</li> <li> <b>Culture as mediation between self and the word: </b>Culture is also an intermediary space between the inner self (the human capacity to project imaginary worlds), and the outside world<sup>[8]</sup>. Within culture, we can attribute new meanings to things and follow these projections to design new artifacts, situations, relations. As a cultural activity, design is not only a rational practice that optimizes its means for certain ends, but also as an exercise in imagination and fiction<sup>[9]</sup>. Fiction takes the form of a "concept", as in CK theory<sup>[10]</sup>, a narrative<sup>[11]</sup>or any other form of exploration of values, materials and languages.</li> </ol>

        <p>Drawing on media studies and semiotics, we analyze the tools of expression, mediation, narratives and data visualization and culture, documentary formats and mediums of expression that enable actors to take a reflexive and creative step back collectively<sup>[5]</sup>. In addition, we implement an anthropological analysis of material cultures, design, consultation, and decision-making rituals, as reservoirs of inspiration for designers. Finally, we study the operations of extraction, discretization, composition and expansion that actors use to transform their environments in a sustainable way.</p><p>The AMC design model allows us to</p><p>    </p><ul> <li>study the meaning of “things” and mediums through semio-pragmatic and technical analyses. We look at how things and mediums embed values, beliefs, rationalities that define certain cultures.</li> <li>conduct ethnographic enquiries that address the interactions of things – living and non living- and people. We are mostly interested in the operations (framing, extraction, discretization, composition, etc.) supported by pliable mediums<sup>[9]</sup>.</li> <li>look for design spaces that have not been explored and could solve issues. This stage uses interdisciplinarity as a means to find other situations, concepts, theories that underdetermine design beliefs and practices and bring new perspectives.</li> <li>design, experiment and evaluate artefacts with the stakeholders.</li> </ul>
