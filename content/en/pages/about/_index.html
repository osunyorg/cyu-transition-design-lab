        <p>Transition Design Lab research relies both on design studies and design science. Focusing on transition paradigme, we recognize three major challenges for design practices:</p><ol> <li>the change in geographical scale;</li> <li>the heterogeneity of actors and their interests;</li> <li>the introduction of long-term regeneration issues. <br> </li> </ol><p>Those challenges lead us to identify, in a multidisciplinary litterature review, five crucial dimensions to design for socio-environmental transitions.</p>

        <p>All our research is based on the AMC model (Actors/Mediums/Cultures). Based on media studies the AMC model allows us to analyse the material culture of design milieu from an anthropological standpoint. In particular, we focus on the informational literacies and communicational infrastructures that support the mediation between actors in transition. We also analyze how artefacts and actors “work together” to achieve innovative goals.</p><p>Thus, the <i>Actors / Mediums / Cultures model</i> studies design activities as both tangible and symbolic operations between actors, media and cultures. It highlights:</p><ul> <li> <p>the fundamental role of the 	"mediums" of conception, debate and decision;</p> 	</li> <li> <p>the specificities of the actors’ cultures (aesthetics, 	social and political values, and modes of legitimization).</p> </li> </ul>

        <p>Drawing on Dewey<sup>[1]</sup> and Schön<sup>[2]</sup>, our model is media-centric, i.e. it starts from a definition of the media as material, medium and mediation. Mediums enable designers to distance themselves<sup>[3]</sup>, to engage in a "conversation" with materials<sup>[4]</sup>, to project imaginaries, to support embodied activity and to make sense of the history of their uses<sup>[5]</sup>.</p><p>We see design mediums as formative matrices<sup>[6]</sup> that give rise to possibilities based on both material and symbolic properties, and the designers' gestures and imagination.</p>

        <p>AMC design model is based on a theory of <b>culture as a design environment</b>, but also as a <b>creative mediation between the inner self and the outside world</b>.</p><ol> <li> <b>Culture as a design environment:</b> Every design activity takes place in a milieu<sup>[7]</sup> that presents the elements of a problem and provides the resources for solutions. The design project is therefore considered as a situated cultural activity. We use anthropology of material cultures and media studies to focus on the mediums (tangible, symbolic) of design and what they make designers do.</li> <li> <b>Culture as mediation between self and the word: </b>Culture is also an intermediary space between the inner self (the human capacity to project imaginary worlds), and the outside world<sup>[8]</sup>. Within culture, we can attribute new meanings to things and follow these projections to design new artifacts, situations, relations. As a cultural activity, design is not only a rational practice that optimizes its means for certain ends, but also as an exercise in imagination and fiction<sup>[9]</sup>. Fiction takes the form of a "concept", as in CK theory<sup>[10]</sup>, a narrative<sup>[11]</sup>or any other form of exploration of values, materials and languages.</li> </ol>
